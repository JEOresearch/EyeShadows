# EyeShadows
Base application for the EyeShadows selection/interaction method

The unity package (Developed with Unity 2020.3.21f1), contains a sample scene with three tasks that make use of the EyeShadows selections/manipulations.

You will need to download/import the following:
- SteamVR (We use the old CameraRig for simplicity)
- Sranipal Eye Framework (ViveSR)
      - Note that we have rewritten the SranipalGazeRay script to EyeShadowGazeRay to handle eye gaze vectors
- XR assets
